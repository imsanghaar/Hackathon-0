# Make a Plan for Tasks Skill

## When to Use

- User says "Make a Plan for tasks"
- User asks to analyze pending tasks
- User requests strategic planning or prioritization
- User wants to understand task execution order

## Procedure

1. **Open the Needs_Action folder** and list all `.md` task files
2. **Read each task file** including frontmatter and content
3. **Analyze each task for:**
   - Task type (from `type` field in frontmatter)
   - Priority level (from `priority` field: high/medium/low)
   - Related files (from `related_files` field)
   - Content complexity (from task description and checklist)
4. **Create a new plan file** in `Plans/` folder:
   - Filename format: `Plan_<timestamp>.md` (e.g., `Plan_2026-02-24_15-30-00.md`)
   - Use the structured format below
5. **Do NOT execute tasks** - This is planning only

## Output Format

Create a plan file with this exact structure:

```markdown
# Plan: <Date/Time>

## Summary of Pending Tasks

Total pending tasks: X

1. **<task_filename>** (Type: <type>, Priority: <priority>)
   - Brief description from content
2. **<task_filename>** (Type: <type>, Priority: <priority>)
   - Brief description from content
...

## Suggested Order of Execution

1. <Task name> - Reason: <why first>
2. <Task name> - Reason: <why second>
3. <Task name> - Reason: <why third>

## Risks or Unclear Items

- ⚠️ <Risk or unclear item 1>
- ⚠️ <Risk or unclear item 2>
- ✅ <Clear item or resolved concern>

## Strategy

<Short paragraph describing the overall approach. Include:
- Processing order rationale
- Any batching recommendations
- Time estimates if applicable
- Dependencies between tasks>

## Planning Guidelines

### Prioritization Rules

1. **High priority tasks** → Process first
2. **File review tasks** → Often provide context for other tasks, process early
3. **Similar task types** → Batch together for efficiency
4. **Tasks with dependencies** → Order by dependency chain

### Risk Identification

Look for:
- Ambiguous task descriptions
- Missing information in frontmatter
- Tasks requiring external access or permissions
- Potentially destructive actions (deletions, overwrites)
- Large or complex files

### Strategy Recommendations

Consider:
- **Batching:** Group similar tasks (all file reviews, all documents, etc.)
- **Dependencies:** Some tasks may provide context for others
- **Time estimates:** Rough estimate for completion
- **Resources needed:** Any special tools or access required

## File Paths

- **Needs_Action folder:** `E:\ai_employee\[Bronze_Tier](Silver_Tier)\Needs_Action\`
- **Plans folder:** `E:\ai_employee\[Bronze_Tier](Silver_Tier)\Plans\`
- **Plan filename:** `Plans/Plan_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`

## Example Plan Output

```markdown
# Plan: 2026-02-24 15:30:00

## Summary of Pending Tasks

Total pending tasks: 3

1. **task_client_meeting_notes.txt.md** (Type: file_review, Priority: high)
   - Client meeting notes requiring immediate attention
2. **task_invoice_2026_001.pdf.md** (Type: file_review, Priority: medium)
   - Invoice document for payment processing
3. **task_team_feedback.md.md** (Type: file_review, Priority: low)
   - Team feedback for quarterly review

## Suggested Order of Execution

1. Client meeting notes - Reason: High priority, time-sensitive client matter
2. Invoice processing - Reason: Medium priority, financial document
3. Team feedback - Reason: Low priority, internal review can wait

## Risks or Unclear Items

- ⚠️ Invoice may require accounting software access
- ⚠️ Team feedback document is large, may need time to analyze
- ✅ All tasks are file reviews, straightforward processing

## Strategy

Process tasks in priority order: high → medium → low. Start with client meeting notes as they are time-sensitive and may reveal action items for other tasks. Invoice processing is routine but requires accuracy. Team feedback can be batched with other internal documents if more arrive. Estimated total processing time: 15-20 minutes.

## Important Rules

- **This is planning ONLY** - Do not execute or modify tasks
- **Do not move files** - Tasks stay in Needs_Action
- **Be concise but thorough** - One page maximum for plan
- **Highlight priorities clearly** - Use visual indicators (🔴 high, 🟡 medium, 🟢 low)
- **Flag unclear items** - If a task is ambiguous, note it in Risks section
- **Provide actionable strategy** - Give clear execution guidance

## Troubleshooting

- **If Needs_Action is empty:** Report "No pending tasks to plan"
- **If task files are corrupted:** Note in Risks section, skip analysis
- **If Plans folder doesn't exist:** Create it automatically
- **If timestamp format fails:** Use simple format `Plan_<unix_timestamp>.md`
